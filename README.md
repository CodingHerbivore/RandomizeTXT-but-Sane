# RandomizeTXT, but Sane
A little project I originally did in C# like a crazy person. This is a tool which takes a txt file with a list of things and spits out a new text file with those things in a different order. This version is written in Ruby, and therefore is only three lines of code (although it lacks the GUI file picker of the original).

The original use case was to shuffle test search keywords that were to be tested by team members. Otherwise, the same member would've gotten several variations of the same keyword.
